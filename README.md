This Simple Calculator was developed as a functional project to apply my knowledge of Java and to provide an easy-to-use tool for basic arithmetic operations. I aim for this project to be both useful for everyday calculations and educational for those looking to understand the basics of Java programming. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, feedback, or if you just want to talk code!

## Description
The Simple Calculator is a Java-based program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The focus of this project was to build a solid foundation in Java programming by implementing user input handling, arithmetic operations, and output formatting.

With this application, users can perform quick calculations and see the results formatted to two decimal places, making it easy to use for financial calculations or any other scenario requiring precision.

## How to Use
1. Download the Java files from the repository.
2. Compile and run the SimpleCalculator.java file.
3. Follow the prompts to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation.
4. The program will display the result of the operation, formatted to two decimal places.

## Technologies Used
- The program uses Java's `java.util.Scanner` class for user input.
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE

## Lessons Learned
- Arithmetic Logic: Implementing basic arithmetic operations in a program.
- Precision Formatting: Formatting numerical output to a fixed number of decimal places.
- User Input: Learning how to capture and process user input effectively.
- Conditional Logic: Using conditional statements to direct program flow based on user input.

## Usage Examples
- 4.7 / 3.8 equals 1.24
